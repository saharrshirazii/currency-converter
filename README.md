𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐏𝐈



I recently built a 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐩𝐩 using 𝐇𝐓𝐌𝐋, 𝐂𝐒𝐒, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭, and it was a great exercise in working with APIs.

The key technology I used was the 𝐅𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐏𝐈, which allows JavaScript to get data from external sources asynchronously. For this project, I integrated the 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐟𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐏𝐈 to fetch live currency conversion rates.

Some highlights from the project:

Populating currency dropdowns dynamically

Updating country flags based on the selected currency

Handling user input safely (like invalid or empty amounts)

Displaying live exchange rates in real-time

This project was a good reminder of:

The importance of 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 and understanding the JSON response structure

Handling errors gracefully when the API doesn’t return the expected data

Working with asynchronous code using async/await

💡 𝐓𝐢𝐩 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬:

 When working with APIs, always log the response first (console.log). It saves hours of debugging when things don’t work as expected!
